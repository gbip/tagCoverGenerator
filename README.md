# What is this ?
A small python script that will generate a cover from the tag contained inside a mp3 or a flac
# Dependencies
This program is written for python3 and uses the mutagen lib for handling audio metadata and cairo for drawing stuff.
So you need to instal both of them `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-tk python3-mutagen python-mutagen`
